# Reflection Document

* Drive Full Name  : Harry Li
* Partner Full Name: Cooper Nazar

* Working with my partner was fairly easy, while we had no problem with dividing the work and everything went well while collaborating. My partner did the algorithm and testing while I did the code. Most of the things went smoothly while I was completing the code besides some of the functions when I was writing them. There were some cases where I was having a hard time transferring the data that I wanted to output onto my main functions and calling them including outputting the assigned seats and organizing the tables. Overall everything else went well and I was also able to learn how to use files better than before and have a better understanding of them.
