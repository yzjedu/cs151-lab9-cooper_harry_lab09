We were meant to learn how to read from a file and write the data onto a new file. Some key concepts that were explored 
were the try/except commands, for loops, and lists. The main challenge was understanding the logistics of using files in 
code, though this was overcome through practice. Working with my partner was good. I was worried that things might not 
go well because I had to attend my grandfather's funeral in Connecticut over the weekend and couldn't use my weekend to 
do work as a result, so my schedule was more limited, but I don't think there were any major issues regarding the assignment.
